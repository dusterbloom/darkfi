These messages are like the network heartbeat- they are sent continually between nodes, to ensure each node is still alive and active. Ping-pong messages ensure that the network doesnâ€™t time out."],["protocol_registry",""],["protocol_seed","Seed server protocol. Seed server is used when connecting to the network for the first time.
